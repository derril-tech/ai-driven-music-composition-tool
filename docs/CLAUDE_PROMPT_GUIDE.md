## ðŸ”§ Advanced Prompt Techniques

### 1. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

```
You are implementing a complex music composition feature. Let's break this down step by step:

STEP 1: Analyze the requirements
- What are the core musical concepts involved?
- What technical constraints must be considered?
- What user experience requirements exist?

STEP 2: Design the architecture
- How should the data flow through the system?
- What interfaces and abstractions are needed?
- How will different components interact?

STEP 3: Implement the solution
- Create the necessary components/services
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive testing

STEP 4: Validate the implementation
- Does it meet all requirements?
- Is it performant and scalable?
- Does it follow best practices?

Please implement this feature following this structured approach.
```

### 2. Few-Shot Learning Prompts

```
Here are examples of well-implemented music components in AriaForge:

EXAMPLE 1 - Track Component:
```typescript
interface TrackProps {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: TrackType;
  color: string;
  volume: number;
  muted: boolean;
  solo: boolean;
}

const Track: React.FC<TrackProps> = ({ id, name, type, color, volume, muted, solo }) => {
  // Implementation with proper TypeScript, accessibility, and music-specific features
};
```

EXAMPLE 2 - Audio Processing Service:
```python
class AudioService:
    async def process_audio(self, audio_data: bytes, format: str) -> AudioResult:
        # Implementation with proper async handling, error management, and audio processing
        pass
```

Now implement a similar component/service following these patterns and conventions.
```

### 3. Constraint-Based Prompting

```
Create a music composition feature with these strict constraints:

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must use TypeScript with strict typing
- Must follow established naming conventions
- Must include comprehensive error handling
- Must be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Must support real-time collaboration
- Must validate music theory rules
- Must be performant (< 100ms response time)
- Must include unit tests
- Must follow security best practices

REQUIREMENTS:
[Specific feature requirements]

OUTPUT: Implementation that satisfies ALL constraints while meeting requirements.
```
